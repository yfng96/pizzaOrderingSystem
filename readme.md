## Pizza Ordering System

This is a simple web application that developed for assignment purpose. 

In this system, there are 3 roles available, which are admin, staffs and users. Admin and staffs can access the admin site, whereas users access the customer site. The role assigned for admin will be ‘A’, staff will be ‘S’, and customer will be ‘U’. Once login, the system will check the role of user and direct the user to the correct page. If the role is admin/staff, the system will direct the user to admin site. If the role is user, the system will direct the user to customer site.

In admin site, admin can manage user data, pizza data and view customer order. Customers can create their own account but staff accounts are created by admin only. After admin creates the staff account, the staff can access the admin site. However, staffs can only view the customer order and view the pizza details. They are prohibited from accessing user data and modified pizza data.

The display output can be view through the [PizzaOrderingSystemDisplay.pdf](/PizzaOrderingSystemDisplay.pdf)
